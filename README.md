## Hi, I am Ket Shao Lun, one of the interviewee and I have complete the task in CLI using python. The source code is attached. Thank you!


## Step to test the code:
## 1) Open Command Prompt (In my case, I use Anaconda Prompt miniconda3)
## 2) Make sure Python is installed in the console
## 3) Make sure Python's Library "keyboard" is installed, else you can use the command below:
##    -> pip install keyboard
## 4) Download the python file "FeedMe.py".
## 5) Run the FeedMe.py in the command prompt using the command below
##    -> python FeedMe.py
## 6) You should be able to see an interface like this
